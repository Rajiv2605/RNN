# Implementation of RNN on MNIST
In this project, I am trying to implement a [Recursive Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network).
I am using <b>Python</b> as the primary language for the program. I am implementing the RNN using **TensorFlow**.
I am using [MNIST Handwriting Recognition Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) as the primary dataset.

For more information, you can checkout the project Wiki. Happy Coding!
